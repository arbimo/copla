/** Provides a flexible assertion support, related to a debug level.
  *
  * DEBUG_LEVEL == 1, should be suitable for a release version of the software, with inexpensive sanity checks.
  * DEBUG_LEVEL 2 and 3, encompass more expensive sanity checks that should only be made in debug mode.
  * DEBUG_LEVEL 4 is reserved to very expensive computation that should never be used except beside development.
  *
  * Default debug level is 3 when java assertions are enabled (VM option "-ea") and 1 otherwise.
  *
  * All assert methods have lazy evaluation of the all parameters, so invocation should be almost for free when above
  * the current DEBUG_LEVEL.
  *
  * Assertion can be remove at compile time with "-Xelide-below" parameter to scalac.
